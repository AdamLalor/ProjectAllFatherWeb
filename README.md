# ProjectAllFatherWeb


## About


ProjectAllFatherWeb is a website based on ProjectAllFather which is a game development side project being worked on by 2 people, that could take a while to develop as to time constraints and tool constraints.


## The Development


The development will be published in dev diaries week by week


## Engine

The engine is down to two engines unity and unreal 4, it will be decided soon.


## What genre of game is it


Its decided to be a fps (first person shooter) but what the game is about is still to be decided


## OS support 


Os support will probably be down to windows 10 or previous versions of windows but linux and mac could be on the roadmap


## Roadmap


The roadmap will be included in the website


## Tools used


(Engine tbd), Blender for 3d modelling and animation photoshop for textures. 


## Release 


No date, this is a side project and probably won't be a perfect game


## Goals 


The goals for the devs is to learn how to make a game and release it to the public, there is no decision if the game will be free to play or payed. (If its payed it probably won't be sold for much)
